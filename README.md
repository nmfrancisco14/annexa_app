# 🐾 Staff ANNEX A Generator

> “I'm not even sure I really need this web app, but I built it anyway…”

Though wala akong spare time, I used my **procrastination powers** to delay real deadlines and create this nonsense (but actually useful) app — para magawa ko ang **ANNEX A** ng team. YEY.

## 🧩 About the App

The **Staff ANNEX A Generator** is a lightweight web tool that helps automate the creation and formatting of **ANNEX A** files for staff members.

It allows users to:
- View their TOR (Terms of Reference) data for a specific period (default: **January–June 2026**)
- Download formatted reports as **Word (.docx)** or **Excel (.xlsx)** files
- Optionally upload their own TOR data file

And yes — **random cats** will appear throughout the app. They’re completely irrelevant to the tool’s function, but undeniably **cute** 😸

## 📘 Instructions

By default, the app already includes **TOR data for January to June 2026**.  
You can navigate and explore your respective TORs by selecting your **name** under *Staff Member* — the corresponding table will be displayed on the right.

### 💾 You can:
- **Download as Word (.docx)** → This is the version you’ll submit to *Rain* 😅

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Staff / Position** | Name and position of the staff member |
| **MFO** | Major Final Output |
| **Major Category** | Task classification |
| **Task / Terms of Reference (ToR)** | Description of activity |
| **E: Measure of Effectiveness** | Numeric output measure |
| **Q: Measure of Quality** | Quality criteria or description |
| **T: Measure of Time** | Timeliness measure (updated per request) |
| **Areas** | Focus areas or regions |
| **Charging Code** | Code or budget reference |

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: Di ko pa natest if may kulang sa variables na yan hehe 😅

## 🐱 Fun but Useless Feature

> “AS usual, random cats will be seen on this web app.”

The app randomly loads images from **TheCatAPI**.  
They serve *absolutely no purpose* other than to make the experience more enjoyable.

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

This project was built out of **procrastination**, **necessity**, and **cat appreciation**. 

ALSO **Big Thanks** to AI Friends (Claude, ChatGPT) for helping me code this app.

### 🪄 Future Plans
- No plans. This may be abandoned. Excpet when looking for cats. Or next contract
